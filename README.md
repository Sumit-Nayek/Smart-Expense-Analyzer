# Smart-Expense-Analyzer
This web application allows users to upload PDF files and automatically generate insightful visualizations (charts, graphs, summaries) using an LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT, LLaMA, or Claude). The system extracts text from PDFs, processes it with an LLM to identify key data points, and presents the results in an intuitive, interactive dashboard.
